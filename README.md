Blackjack – Small Python Project

This is a basic Blackjack game I built for one of the Applied Learning Tasks in Leaving Certificate Computer Science.

It’s a simple text-based game played in the terminal. You draw cards, try to get as close to 21 as possible, and play against a CPU dealer.

How to Play
	•	Run the script using Python.
	•	Choose to hit (draw a card) or stand (end your turn).
	•	Aces count as 1 or 11. Dealer plays after you stand.
	•	Try not to go over 21!

How to Run - python blackjack.py in Terminal.
